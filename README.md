## About Me

Sales has shaped my career and life, becoming more than just a profession, it’s a lifestyle built on empathy, intention, and real connections. With a background spanning Big Tobacco, Pharma, Entrepreneurship, and SaaS, I’ve learned that success goes beyond closing deals. It’s about understanding people, solving problems, and building trust to create lasting partnerships.

Now transitioning into tech sales, I bring the same drive and grit that guided me but with an added focus on relationships. I thrive in helping teams and clients grow through meaningful collaboration and thoughtful solutions that make an impact.
