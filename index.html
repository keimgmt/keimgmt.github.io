    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Sales has shaped my career and life in ways I never imagined. It’s not just about closing deals—it’s about building real connections, understanding people, and making a lasting impact. I’ve had the privilege of working across Big Tobacco, Pharma, Entrepreneurship, and now tech, gaining valuable insights and fostering relationships that go beyond transactions.</p>
    <p>My journey hasn’t been traditional, but it’s one I wouldn’t trade. Sales is more than a profession to me, it’s a lifestyle built on empathy, intention, and growth. Now transitioning into tech sales, I bring the same passion, drive, and a focus on helping teams and businesses thrive through meaningful partnerships and solutions.</p>
